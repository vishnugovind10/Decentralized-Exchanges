# Decentralized-Exchanges
Dexes, short for decentralized exchanges, are platforms that facilitate the peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies and digital assets without relying on a central authority or intermediary. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, which require users to deposit their funds with the exchange itself, decentralized exchanges allow users to retain control of their funds and trade directly from their personal wallets.

Dexes operate on blockchain networks, typically utilizing smart contracts to automate and enforce the trading process. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined rules that facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. By leveraging the transparency, immutability, and security features of blockchain technology, dexes aim to provide a more decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant alternative to centralized exchanges.

There are different types of dexes, including order book-based dexes and automated market maker (AMM) dexes. Order book dexes function similarly to traditional exchanges, matching buy and sell orders from users and creating a centralized order book. AMM dexes, on the other hand, rely on liquidity pools and algorithms to determine asset prices. Users trade against these pools, and the prices are adjusted based on supply and demand.

Dexes offer several advantages over centralized exchanges, such as increased privacy, reduced reliance on intermediaries, lower trading fees, and greater security against hacking and theft. They also enable users to maintain control over their private keys and have access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including those that may not be listed on centralized exchanges.
